# Deliverable One

In this document we will explain which requirements were not met and why.

## Sliding animations
Our highest priorities were given to writing clean, high quality and readable
code. Due to time constraints and the complexity of these animations, the code
we implemented to support this feature wasn't completely finished. We could get
it working on time, but the code would be very messy. As we though we did not 
have enough time to properly clean this up, we decided not to implement sliding
animations.

## TrueType fonts
The fonts in our game are not anti-aliased. We thought using TrueType fonts would
fix this, but apparantly it did not. As such, we have decided to fall back to the
old behaviour and keep using Bitmap fonts.
