# Sprint Backlog for sprint 1

01. ~~Configure LibGDX with Maven.~~
02. ~~Setup DevHub.~~
03. ~~Setup GitHub.~~

04. ~~The game is won when two tiles of value 1024 merge into a single 2048 tile.~~
05. ~~A score should be kept of the progress of the game. Merging two tiles adds the
    value of the merged tile to the score.~~
06. ~~Only tiles of the same value can be merged.~~
07. ~~Two tiles of the same value are merged into one single tile when they
    collide.~~
08. ~~The value of the resulting tile will be the sum of the two tiles.~~
09. ~~Two tiles cannot merge into one if one of them has already been merged this
    move.~~
10. ~~Every move, all tiles should move into that direction, for the greatest
    distance possible.~~
11. ~~Initially, the grid should contain only two tiles with either value 2 or 4.~~
12. The player can move around tiles on the grid using the four arrow keys on the
    keyboard.
13. ~~Moves can go into the upper, lower, left and right direction.~~
14. ~~Tiles can not go off-grid.~~
15. ~~Moves are only valid when adjacent squares in the direction of the movement
    have the same value, or are empty.~~
16. ~~After every valid move a new tile should appear, with a value of either 2 or
    4.~~
17. ~~The chance of a new tile appearing with the value 2 is 90%, in contrast to a
    chance of 10% on a value of 4.~~
18. ~~When no more moves are possible before the game is won, the game is lost.~~
19. ~~The game ends when the player loses.~~
20. After winning the game, the user can decide to keep playing or restart the
    game.
21. After the user has won the game and keeps playing, the user can only increase
    the highscore, and is thus playing in endless mode.
22. In endless mode, the player can still lose the game for the above mentioned
    criteria.

23. ~~The interface should display a board to the user with a 4x4 grid on it.~~
24. ~~There should be an indication of the current score, the highscore and the
    highest tile ever reached.~~
25. ~~There should be a replay button.~~
26. ~~Tiles of different values should have different colors.~~
