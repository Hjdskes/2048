* The application has to be a game.
* The game should be able to be started and restarted by the user.
* The game ends when the player loses.
* The interface should display a board to the user with a 4x4 grid on it.
* Initially, the grid should contain only two tiles with either value 2 or 4. Both tiles can't have the value 4, but they can both have the value 2.
* The game can be won.
* The game is won when two tiles of value 1024 merge into a single 2048 tile.

* Every move, all tiles should move into that direction, for the greatest distance possible.
