#Test Report

In this report discusses how we tested our game. We will start with explaining how often we tested our game. Secondly, we explain what kind of testing we did. And lastly we will give the results of the tests.

###Frequency 


In this section we discuss how frequently we tested our game. In the first week we started developing the game rapidly and didn’t write any test cases. After this first week it’s was clear that we had to test sooner because we used agile software development, which means there are many iterations in our code and our code did change rapidly. So it is very important that we incorporated testing in our development. The second week we wrote a lot of tests and wrote them faster after implementing a specific feature. ###Kind of testing
In this section we discuss what kind of testing we did. We used both functional testing and static testing. Functional testing means that we test our game by just launching the game and observing what happens. We did use this technique in the first week to implement the basics of the game.We made test cases to do static testing. These cases where for one method to test if this method did what we expected.###Results
In this section we discuss the results of our tests. After the functional testing we got rid of most bugs that could influence the game. Our line coverage using our test cases is 79 percent. We could not test the classes GameRenderer, ButtonHandler and GameScreen. These three classes where used for creating the graphical user interface. Devhub cannot initialize any graphical user interface on its server so any test we tried to write for these three classes cause a build failure. In every other class we have a very high test coverage so we are confident that our game is tested more than sufficiently.
