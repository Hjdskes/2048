# Requirements specification logger

The goal is to develop a logging feature in our 2048 clone.

All of the requirements have each been given a unique identifier.

## Functional Requirements:

* L1: The logger should support several log levels: NONE, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG.
* L2: The NONE level mutes all logging.
* L3: The ERROR level logs only error messages.
* L4: The INFO level logs all error and normal messages.
* L5: The DEBUG level logs all messages.
* L6: The logging output should be redirectable to a file.
