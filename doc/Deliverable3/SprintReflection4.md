|               | Pattern 3 | Jochem   	  | 6 hours          |	4 hours		 | Yes  |   |
| Assignment 3  | 3.0  		| Arthur      | 6 hours          |	5 hours		 | Yes  |   |



##Problem encountered
***Description:*** We have underestimated the time on each exercise 
There are always some tasks that take longer than expected. This was because we used a very basic Sprint plan missing a lot of tasks. Next time we will split each assignment in more concrete tasks so the estimated effort is easier to determine. 
The next sprint we can use a point system to determine the estimated effort each task needs.


***Description:*** After using LibGDX's internal logging functionality, we wrote our own logger class as it turned out we had to implement our own logging feature.
