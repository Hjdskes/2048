## 1 Introduction ##
2048 is a very popular game created by by Gabriele Cirulli. Based on 1024 by Veewo
Studio and conceptually similar to Threes by Asher Vollmer.

We are five Computer Science students at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. We created a clone of the original 2048 game for the course Software Engineering Methods and, well, not to toot our own horn, but in our opinion, we did a pretty good job. :P
We didn't only make a clone of the original 2048 game, we also added multiplayer functionality. Now, you can challenge your neighbours, your coworkers, your kids or even the Queen of England to play a game of 2048!

This document tells you everything to get you started and technical aspects of the game are covered in here as well. 

Setting up a multiplayer game is really straightforward, however. Just make sure incoming connections to port TCP/2048 reach the hosting machine! Yes, port 2048! Who would have thunk it? 
More details are up ahead!

Good luck and have fun!

P.S.: We, the developers, are not reliable in case of frustration. ;)
