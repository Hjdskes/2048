## User Stories

###Story 1

As a user, I want to be able to choose which solver I want to use. I want the chosen solver to be saved.
	
### Story 2
	
As a user, I want to be able to set a difficulty in the singleplayer game. This means that the spawn of a new tile isn't random anymore. 
It spawns the new tile on difficult places to increase the difficulty of the game

## Main Problems encountered

***Description:*** Giving the task of implementing TrueType fonts to Piet was not a good idea. Piet
uses a Macbook with a Retina display, on which even TrueType fonts look aliased.
As such, he thought they weren't working and almost reverted all his changes.  
***Reaction:*** Before throwing everything away, we tested it on another machine on which it
worked just fine. Next time, we will try to keep such things in mind.
