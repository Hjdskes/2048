Your requirements could be slightly more verbose, but I like their preciseness and that you have clearly taken my feedback into consideration. Good job!

I love your game! It contains nothing more than it must, the pop-up animation of the tiles are beautiful and the user interface is almost indistinguishable from the original 2048. The highscore works nicely even across reboots. Excellent!

Formatting/Naming/Comments: Generally very well done and a lot of effort went into polishing it, which I highly value. Some points to improve your work: Your java doc is redundant:
	/**
	 * Returns the Preferences object.
	 * 
	 * @return The Preferences object.
	 */

Why not only @return or Returns ... ? You can increase readability by leaving empty spaces in between field declarations:
	/** The brown font. */
	private static final BitmapFont BROWN_F = AssetHandler.font;
	/** The white font. */
	private static final BitmapFont WHITE_F = AssetHandler.whiteFont;
	/** The gap between the top of the game window and the score text. */
	private static final int SCORE_HEIGHT = 50;
	/** A reference to the GameWorld, which is used to interact with the game. */
	private GameWorld world;
	/** A reference to the AnimatedGrid. */
	private AnimatedGrid grid;
	/** The orthographic camera, to make the scene appear 2D. */
	private OrthographicCamera cam;
	/** The SpriteBratch is used to draw all Sprite objects. */
	private SpriteBatch batch;

Remove the  * @author group-21 tags, this is obvious (there are many good reasons not to mention the author of a particular piece of code in a comment, besides).

Testing: Well done!


An overall remark: I am very happy with your work.
